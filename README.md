  Where COVID-19 Matters
</h1>

<p>
This Gatsby built application allows a user to monitor Covid-19 across the United States with zip codes. Victory is used for data presentation. Leaflet is used for mapping. Reach Router is used to implement client-only routing for detail pages. Data is sourced from the COVID Tracking Project, The New York Times via COVID-19 Data Tracking API, and Here Geocoding and Search API. Big Data Cloud API is used to reverse geocode a user's geolocation to a zip code. A special thanks to SmartyStreets, who granted me additional free API calls for zip code validation.

<p>Below is a demonstration video from when the website was functional. Data is no longer available for retrieval since COVID-19 became endemic.</p>
